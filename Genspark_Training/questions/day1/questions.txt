q1. Declare a variable to represent temperature in Celsius.
Convert this temperature to Fahrenheit using the formula

Use fmt.Printf instead of Println
// fmt.Printf verbs could be found on top of fmt documentation // https://pkg.go.dev/fmt#hdr-Printing
Use type casting in Go


q2. Create a program to store and print a person's and their project's details. Declare and initialize variables for the following details,
    Project name (string)
    Code lines written (uint8)
    Bugs found (int)
    Is the project complete? (bool)
    Average lines of code written per hour (float64)
    Team lead name (string)
    Project deadline in days (int)
    Additionally, demonstrate a uint overflow by initializing the largest possible value for uint and then adding 1 to it


q3. Use log.New() and print a log message
    use shortfile flag and stdFlags for flag argument (bit of Google required)
// Hint:- first value to this function could be os.Stdout
// Printing: l.Println("hello this is first log message")

q4. Print default values and Type names of variables from question 2 using printf
// Quick Tip, Use %v if not sure about what verb should be used,
// but don't use it in this question :)
// but generally using %v should be fine


q5. {
      "name": "Alice",
      "age": 25
    }

    C:\Users\Alice\Documents\example.txt

    Store above data in string
