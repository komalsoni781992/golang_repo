q3. Create the following directory structure
            app-/
                ├──stores/
                │  └── store.go
                   └── models.go // to store domain structs
                │    ├── mysql/
                │    │   └── mysql.go
                │    ├── postgres/
                │       └── postgres.go
                └── main.go
                ├── go.mod

    In mysql.go create a Conn struct which stores db connection in string form
    Create three methods over Conn struct (Create(user) error, Update(name) error, Delete(id) error
    //Note:- return nil for the errors, assume no error would happen
    //For now add simple print statement without doing any actual work

    In postgres.go repeat the same steps as we did in mysql.go

    In store.go
        Create an interface that postgres and mysql package can implement

    In main.go
        Call postgres and mysql package methods using interface variable


q4. Create a map in postgres.go and mysql.go to store user details in the memory
    Change the signature of methods (Create(user) bool, Update(name) bool, Delete(id) bool)
    Note:- true would indicate operation has been successful.
    Add two new methods FetchAll, FetchUser(id)
    This time write concrete functionalities not simple print statements
