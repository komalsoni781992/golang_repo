q2. Create an Interface with one method square(int)
    Create a type that implements this interface
    The type has one field that stores the currentSquare value
    Create a function Operation that can call the square method using the interface

    In the main function, create a nil pointer to the concrete type
    Pass the value to the operation function

    Operation function calls the method that implements the interface

    Try to do recovery from panic at different levels
