q1. create a function work that takes a work id and print work {id} is going on
    In the main function run a loop to run work function 10 times
    make the work function call concurrent
    Make sure your program waits for work function to finish gracefully

q2. Follow up to the previous question
    Spin up one anonymous goroutine in the work function
    This goroutine prints some stuff on the screen and sleeps for 100ms
    Make sure you wait for every goroutine to finish and end everything gracefully


q3. Create a bookCab function that takes the name of the user trying to book a cab
    Assume only one user can book a cab at a time
    Create a global variable to hold the number of cabs available

    Check if a cab is available, if yes print a msg cab is available otherwise unavailable

    In the main function, run a loop 5 times and call bookCab function as goroutine to simulate
    multiple users are trying to book a cab
