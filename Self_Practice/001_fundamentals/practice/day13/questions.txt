q1. Create a slice with 3 random urls
    Create a function doGetRequest()
    doGetRequest:
        It spins up 2 goroutines
        1st goroutines do get request and put the url,resp,err inside one single channel
        //1st goroutine spins up n number of goroutines for n number of urls (fanout pattern)
        2nd goroutines fetch the values from the channel and perform following operations
            -check err
            -read body
            -check if status code above 299
            -and print url resp.Status
