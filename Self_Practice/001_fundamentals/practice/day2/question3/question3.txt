q3. create two files in the package main as shown below

     third-proj-day-2/
        ├──cmd/
        │  └── main.go
        │  └──setup.go
        ├── auth/
        │  └── auth.go (it has one function which prints authenticating user)
        ├── go.mod

     ** Use go run to run this project **
     To run the project
     cd cmd
     go run . or go run *.go

     setup.go and main.go both belong to package main
     Setup.go -> print some setup messages
     main.go -> call setup function, call auth.Authenticate, and print "end of the main"
