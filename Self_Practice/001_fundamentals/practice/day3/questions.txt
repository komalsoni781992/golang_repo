Q1. Write a Go program that:
    Creates an empty slice with an initial capacity of 1.
    Appends integers from 1 to 1,000,000 to the slice.
    Tracks and prints the capacity change every time the slice's capacity increases.
    Prints the total number of capacity changes at the end.

    Formula:= (currentCap-lastCap) / lastCap * 100
    // Hint :- use type casting


Q2. Create an initial list of users.
    Create a new slice named as emp from a part users slice.
    Check both slices length and capacity.

    Append some more user names to the *user* slice.
    Check len, cap again for both slices
    Print the values as well

    Append some emp names to the *emp* slice
    Check len, cap again for both slices
    Print the values as well

    Compare the contents and capacities of the original list and the modified slice.
    Try to understand and visualize what is happening


Q3. Create a function that takes a list of users
    This func can append new values to the list or change the existing elems
    But Make sure this function can't modify the original slice
    that was created in the main function
