q4. Modify the above function to perform the following action
    stringManipulation(trimSpace(), "\ngfdngbk \n"))
    Instead of passing trimSpace you need to call the trimSpace function and make the program work
    Hint: you need to return a function with the signature of what stringManipulation accepts as first parameter
    package main
