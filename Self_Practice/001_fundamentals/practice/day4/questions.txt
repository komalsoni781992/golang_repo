q1. Build a simple CLI calculator to get familiar with Go syntax and basic operations.
    Create a new project named as cli
    Create a package calc
    Add functionalities of +, -, /, % (create these functionalities in 4 different files)
    In the main.go file ask user to provide operation to be performed and two values
    Note: User should pass these values from the command line.
    E.g. + 10 20
    Handle errors in the code and give useful error messages to the end user.

            cli/
            ├──cmd/
            │  └── main.go
            ├── calc/
            │  └── add.go
               └── sub.go
               └── mod.go
               └── multiply.go
            ├── go.mod

q2. Create a function that converts a string to float64, if it is successful it returns the value otherwise an error

q3. Create a function named as StringManipulation.
    StringManipulation accepts a function and string type as an argument, and it returns string value
    Possible Functions that it can accept:- trimSpace, toUpper, greet

    Create 3 functions trimSpace, toUpper, greet
    TrimSpace:- TrimSpace returns a string, with all leading and trailing white space removed, as defined by Unicode.
    ToUpper:- ToUpper returns string with all Unicode letters mapped to their upper case.
    Greet: - It takes a name as input, add hello as greeting and return the greeting
    Hint: use strings package for TrimSpace and ToUpper functionalities


q4. Modify the above function to perform the following action
    stringManipulation(trimSpace(), "\ngfdngbk \n"))
    Instead of passing trimSpace you need to call the trimSpace function and make the program work
    Hint: you need to return a function with the signature of what stringManipulation accepts as first parameter
